\cventry{2020--2022}{Data Engineer and Analyst}{unumAI}{Denver, CO}{}{
    Developed company data management software from mathematical specifications
    with focus on collection and processing of Google Trends Search data for
    political prediction and issue analysis research.
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Led company technical development through implementation of most
        company methodologies using advanced Python, DAX, Azure, and SQL, to
        facilitate easy collection, transformation, warehousing, and PowerBI
        presentation of Google Trends Search data.
    \item   Designed and implemented the unumAI internal module \emph{pyunum},
        containing Python interfaces to custom Google Trends data collection
        submodules and company specific data formatting and transformation.
    \item   Used asynchronous request tooling in tandem with Azure Function
        Applications to increase data collection speeds by orders of magnitude
        at very low cost.
    \item   Integrated Azure tooling for company data maintenance to provide a
        foundational and extensible software platform for data integration that
        is accessible to those not necessarily familiar with programming methods
        or languages.
    \item   Assisted company clients during product and project pitch
        presentations by clarifying technical aspects of methodology, or with
        outright presentation of material to prospective client teams when
        needed.
    \item   Exhibited a strong ability to think quickly and understand new
        domain specific knowledge across fields as applied to a specific
        question or technical problem.
    \item   Demonstrated self-sufficiency in a remote environment, managing
        expectations and workload on a team of only two people in a fast-paced,
        early-stage start-up environment, with rapidly evolving project
        directives that result from changing client needs.
    \item   Some of the clients served at unumAI: Children's Hospital Colorado,
        Partner's for Children's Mental Health, Missouri Department of Health
        and Senior Services, and Siena College Research Institute, and
        political campaigns. An exhaustive list can be found at
        \href{https://www.unumai.org}{unumai.org}.

\cventry{2019--2020}{Data Management and Analytics Specialist}{Bright Event
Rentals}{San Diego, CA}{}{Assisted company analytics endeavors through
    CyberQuery programming on database of transactions, rental equipment, and
    customers
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Wrote customized and automated database queries using CyberQuery to
        improve rental business analytics and reporting.
    \item   Facilitated major revenue generation by using historical data to
        optimize sales of equipment rental protection policies.
    \item   Classified customers in terms of business strategy goals using data
        to identify inconsistencies between company locations.

\cventry{Summer 2017}{Independent Research in Math}{Northwestern
    University}{Evanston, IL}{}{Developed a concept of \emph{mathematical
        fragility} in birth and death stochastic processes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Used \texttt{Python} and accompanying analytical tools to develop a
        preliminary model through simulation of birth and death stochastic
        processes.
    \item   Mathematically analyzed examples to verify properties of these
        preliminary models.
    \item   Abstractly developed these preliminary models using mathematical
        tools from probability to draw out quantities that describe the
        fragility of a process.
